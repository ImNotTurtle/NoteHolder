# What's in this Project?
- A program to manage your notes effectively, intuitively, and conveniently.

## What do I mean by intuitive?
- Just as you would imagine when talking about intuition: your notes are stored in a 2D space, where they can be moved freely, resized, zoomed in and out at will.
- Additionally, the program has a note management window that helps you locate the note you need in case you forget where it is.

## What do I mean by convenient?
- The convenience I refer to partly comes from the intuitive display of notes, making it quick to add new notes.
- Another feature is that the program will remember the notes you recently opened, so everything appears unchanged when you reopen the program.

## What is the goal of this program?
- My main concern in developing this program is to store multiple notes in one place without worrying about losing them over time.

# What did I gain from this project?
- This is the first program I developed using the wxWidgets framework, serving as a practical exercise to enhance my software programming skills.
- Through this project, I learned:
  - How to use a library, study, and read sample codes to filter and apply them to my needs.
  - Practiced Object-Oriented programming skills and complex concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
  - Understood a part of the software flow thinking.
